# [Project 1: Brain Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/YashikaJain35/Brain-Stroke-Prediction)
A stroke is a brain attack, cutting off crucial blood flow and oxygen to the brain. Stroke arises when a blood artery feeding the brain gets clogged or bursts.           Identifying stroke and taking medical action immediately can not only lengthen life but also help to prevent heart disease in the future.
* The datasets have been taken from the Kaggle website
* SVMSMOTE algorithm is used for oversampling from minority class with undersampling algorithm Random undersampling as hybrid technique for Balancing the imbalance data.
* Achieved accuracy of 95% using Random Forest algorithm.
