# [Project 1: Brain Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/YashikaJain35/Brain-Stroke-Prediction)
A stroke is a brain attack, cutting off crucial blood flow and oxygen to the brain. Stroke arises when a blood artery feeding the brain gets clogged or bursts.           Identifying stroke and taking medical action immediately can not only lengthen life but also help to prevent heart disease in the future.
* The datasets have been taken from the Kaggle website
* SVMSMOTE algorithm is used for oversampling from minority class with undersampling algorithm Random undersampling as hybrid technique for Balancing the imbalance data.
* Achieved accuracy of 95% using Random Forest algorithm.

# [Project 2: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction](https://github.com/YashikaJain35/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction)
The Medical Insurance Cost Prediction project is an exciting application of Python and machine learning that enables accurate cost forecasting based on individual demographics and lifestyle choices. This project combines data science and healthcare insights to model how factors like age, BMI, and smoking habits influence medical insurance expenses. It offers a practical solution for insurance providers, healthcare professionals, and even individuals to better understand and anticipate costs.

# [Project 3: Bike Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/YashikaJain35/Bike-Insurance-Prediction/tree/main)
The Bike Insurance Prediction project is designed to predict whether an individual will purchase bike insurance based on various personal and vehicle-related attributes. This project leverages machine learning to identify potential insurance buyers by analyzing factors such as age, vehicle age, driving history, and insurance history. This type of model can help insurance companies effectively target and tailor their marketing strategies.
* A classification model is built using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, all well-suited to binary classification problems.
* The modelâ€™s effectiveness is assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC, which provide a comprehensive view of its performance in predicting potential insurance buyers.
* Achieved accuracy of 87% using DecisionTreeClassifier.
